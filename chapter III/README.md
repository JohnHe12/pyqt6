Adding More Functionality with Widgets
======================================

* Be introduced to event handling and Qt’s signals and slots mechanism

* Build GUIs using new widget classes, including QPushButton, QLineEdit, QCheckBox, and QMessageBox

* Learn about useful methods for aligning text and adjusting widget sizes

* Discover more about windows and dialog boxes and see how to create classes that inherit from QDialog

* Create an application that teaches how to handle multiple windows Before jumping into any code, let’s learn a little about event handling in PyQt.


Event Handlers and Signals and Slots
------------------------------------


 In Qt, events are objects created from the **QEvent** class.
 
 The communication between objects in Qt, such as widgets, is handled by signals and slots. **Signals** are generated whenever an event occurs, such as when a button is clicked or a checkbox is toggled on or off. Those signals then need to be handled in some way. **Slots** are the methods that are connected to an event and executed in response to the signal

```python
                    button.clicked.connect(self.buttonClicked)
```



The QPushButton Widget
----------------------

The **QPushButton** widget can be used to perform actions and make choices. When you click on the QPushButton widget, it sends out a signal that can be connected to a function

**Note** there are different kinds of button classes with different usages, 
such as QToolButton for selecting items in toolbars and QRadioButton for 
creating groups of buttons where only a single selection can be made.

The QLineEdit Widget
--------------------

It is often necessary for a user to input a single line of text, such as a username or a password. With the **QLineEdit** widget, you can collect data from someone

___________________________________________________________________________
**Tip** if you need multiple lines for a user to enter text, 
use the QTextEdit widget instead.

The QCheckBox Widget
--------------------

The **QCheckBox** widget is a selectable button that generally has two states: on and off. This makes them perfect for representing features in your GUI that can either be enabled or disabled, or for selecting from a list of options like in a survey.

```python
                        after_cb.toggled.connect(self.printSelected)
```
___________________________________________________________________________
**Note** the checkboxes in QCheckBox are not mutually exclusive, 
meaning you can select more than one checkbox at a time. 
to make them mutually exclusive, add the checkboxes to a QButtonGroup object 
or consider using QRadioButton.

## The QMessageBox Dialog

When a user closes an application or saves their work, or an error occurs, they will typically see a dialog box pop up and display some sort of key information. The user can then interact with that dialog box, often by clicking a button to respond to the prompt. Dialog boxes are a very important form of **feedback**, or methods of monitoring and communicating changes back to the user.

The **QMessageBox** class can be used to not only alert the user to a situation but also to decide how to handle the matter. For example, when closing a document you just modified, you might get a dialog box with buttons asking you to Save, Don’t Save, or Cancel.

There are two kinds of dialog boxes. 
* **Modal dialogs**  :   block user interaction from the rest of the program until the dialog box is closed. 

* **Modeless dialogs** : allow the user to interact with both the dialog and the rest of the application.
